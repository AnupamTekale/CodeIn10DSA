# Recursive Tree
It is the pictorial/graphical representation of a recursion. It is used to solve and/or better understand a recursive pattern

**Question :** Program to calculate 2<sup>n</sup> , n starts from 1

**Logic :** 2<sup>4</sup> = 2 * 2<sup>3</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2<sup>2</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

Therefore we can say that we can write :-  

F(n) = 2*F(n-1)              This is our recursive call
